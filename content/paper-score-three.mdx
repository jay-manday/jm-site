A series of studies on inter-relationship of emergent media in concurrence with traditional mediums such as paper-craft through a concomitant compositional schema.
<br />
<br />
The composition consists of the recordings of the physical formulation of pulp to paper, projected through the paper via transducers while the piece was at rest, awaiting activation by the realization of an inter-dependent score.
<br />
<br />
As the participant channels the instructions, the transitory motion of pencil in hand across paper, producing acoustic artifacts which are projected through same paper of causation.
