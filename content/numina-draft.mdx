Numina is a deploy-anywhere sensor solution that gives cities unprecedented traffic data.

Numina makes cities more responsive by empowering them with the most comprehensive and dynamic view of the multimodal traffic available yet through a deploy anywhere, privacy-first sensor platform. Numina employs a suite of Computer Vision and Machine Learning mechanisms to process traffic flows in real time on the edge.

Deployed in several cities across the United States and Europe, helping city planners make decisions on how to make communities more responsive, equitable and resilient. During my time with Numina I built several services ranging from administrative tools to monitor devices in the field across the US and Europe, Installation utilities for iOS and Android, Visualization Suites, Customer and Partner facing portals among others.
