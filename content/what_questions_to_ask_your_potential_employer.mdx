# What questions to ask your potential employer?

## Intro

Sooner or later each of us starts looking for a new job. Reasons can be different. Higher salary expectations or maybe you want to get more responsibilities. It just happens and it's ok. You check open positions in companies around and start interview processes. Interview process mostly focuses on evaluating your skills. Technical skills, communication skills, leadership skills and so on.

The only problem with that is that after hours of wasted time talking about scalability, ideal code, computer science problems you join the company and see that process are shitty, architecture is shitty, the code is horrible, teammates are not motivated, and there is no team spirit, no product vision and so on. (Of course, I'm exaggerating)

To prevent that situation from happening, you should turn the interview process in a two-way conversation. Take the initiative and ask your questions, questions that are important for you. My personal formula is to evaluate three pillars of a good company: *Product Vision*, *Technical Vision*, *Team and engineering culture*.

## Three pillars of a good company:

- Technical vision
- Team and engineering culture

# Final points

Make sure you did your homework preparing for interview:

* During interview take initiative and ask questions that are important for you
* Pay attention to all small details during all stages of interview process

Good luck!
